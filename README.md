# Project: Letterklok 

## Description
The Character Clock is a unique timekeeping device that presents the current time using alphanumeric characters or symbols instead of traditional numerical or analog representations. It offers a creative and eye-catching way to display the time, adding both functionality and aesthetic appeal to any space.

This project aims to create a customizable character clock using readily available electronic components and programming techniques. The clock will feature a customizable display, allowing users to choose different character sets, fonts, and display modes to suit their preferences.


## Features
- Displays time using characters or symbols
- Customizable character sets and fonts
- Adjustable brightness and display modes
- Real-time clock functionality with accurate timekeeping

## Option for additional features:
- Weather forecasts 
- Animations
- Customizable messages

## Project Components
- **Hardware**: Includes a microcontroller, 2x 5m LED Strips, 2x power supply, and any additional components required for the specific design.
- **Software**: The firmware for the microcontroller, written in the programming language C++. This software controls the display, handles timekeeping functions, and manages user settings.
- **Enclosure**: Design files for the physical enclosure housing the clock components, which can be 3D-printed, lazercut or fabricated using other methods.
- **Electrical Architecture**: Schematics and PCB layouts detailing the electrical connections and components used in the project.

## Getting Started
To build and customize the Character Clock:
1. Assemble the hardware components according to the provided schematics.
2. Upload the firmware to the microcontroller.
3. Customize the software to adjust display settings and additional features as desired.
4. Fabricate or 3D-print the enclosure and assemble the clock components within it.
5. Test the functionality of the clock and make any necessary adjustments or improvements.
